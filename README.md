Congratulations! After a lot of hard work in the data munging mines, you've landed a job as Lead Analyst for an independent gaming company. You've been assigned the task of analyzing the data for their most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.

Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, the company would like you to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.

As final considerations:

You must use the Pandas Library and the Jupyter Notebook. You must submit a link to your Jupyter Notebook with the viewable Data Frames. You must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data. See Example Solution for a reference on expected format.
